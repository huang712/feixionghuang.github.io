I am a research fellow at National Space Science Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences (NSSC/CAS). I am now working on developing and optimizing operational GNSS-R product for satellite missions such as Fengyun-3 series.

My research interests are GNSS-R and Signals of Opportunity (SoOP), including
* Instrument design
* Data Calibration
* Retrieval of geophysical parameters such as ocean surface wind speed, significant wave height, etc.
* Data assimilation in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models
* Synergies with other microwave remote sensing techniques such as radiometer, scatterometer, altimeter, SAR and GNSS radio occultation
