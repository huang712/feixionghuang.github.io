I am a researcher at National Space Science Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences (NSSC/CAS). I mainly work to develop and optimize operational GNSS-R product for satellite missions such as Fengyun-3 series.

My research interests are GNSS-R ocean applications, including
* Data Calibration
* Retrieval such as ocean surface wind speed, significant wave height, etc.
* Data assimilation in numerical weather prediction models
* Synergies with other microwave remote sensing techniques such as radiometer, scatterometer, altimeter, SAR and GNSS radio occultation
